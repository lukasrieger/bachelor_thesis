\newcommand{\thesisabstract} {As part of the VerifyThis2020 challenge, the new HAGRID PGP server has been proposed as this year's verification target. In this thesis, we elaborate on our submission for this challenge and present an information flow testing approach based on history traces. Through this approach, we determine the exact set of information declassifiable by HAGRID, allowing us to test both functional correctness and privacy of information. Our tests target both an abstract model written in Scala, as well as the actual implementation of HAGRID. }
